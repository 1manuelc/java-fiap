INTRODUCTION TO JAVA AND DATABASES

    Every large scale program nowadays need to have a database
    integrated, to get, set, update and delete data from common
    operations.

    Even if it's in one file of backup or in cloud and local
    databases, programs made in the programming languages based in
    object-oriented paradigm have many alternatives of backup.

    Previously, we viewed how to write and read files in Java, now
    we gonna' see how Java connects and interacts with Oracle Database.


DBMS (Database Management System, SGBD in Portuguese).

    We'll connect our Java program with a DBMS, a software capable to
    create and manipulate databases with ease.

    Java uses an API called JDBC (Java Database Connection), it's a set
    of well-defined Interfaces who provide connection with the DBMS.

    Every enterprise of databases have it's own set of
    instructions (libraries) inside the JDBC, properly
    for connect perfectly the Java program and the DBMS,
    with a single and centered API.

    Exemplifying, if you want to change your database 
    without much work, you need only to change the
    library in use in your JDBC Interface.
