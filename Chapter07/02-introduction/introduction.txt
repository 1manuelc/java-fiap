INTRODUCTION TO JAVA AND DATABASES

    Every large scale program nowadays needs to have a database
integrated, to get, set, update and delete data from common
operations.

    Even if it's in one file of backup or in cloud and local
databases, programs made in the programming languages based in
object-oriented paradigm have many alternatives to back up.

    Previously, we viewed how to write and read files in Java, now
we're going to see how Java connects and interacts with Oracle Database.


DBMS (Database Management System, SGBD in Portuguese).

    We'll connect our Java program with a DBMS, software capable
of creating and manipulating databases with ease.

    Java uses an API called JDBC (Java Database Connection). It's a set
of well-defined Interfaces that provide connection with the DBMS.

    Every enterprise of databases has its own set of
instructions (libraries) inside the JDBC, properly
for connect perfectly the Java program and the DBMS,
with a single and centered API.

    Exemplifying, if you want to change your database
without much work, you need only to change the
library in use in your JDBC Interface.
