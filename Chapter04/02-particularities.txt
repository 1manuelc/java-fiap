    Logically we'll need to use the superclass attributes for some reason and context, for this:
    Insert the prefix "super." to refer to the superclass features inside his subclasses.

    example:
        public double getBalanceAvailable() {
                return super.getBalance() + this.specialCheckBalance; // Uses super."feature" to use the current
                                                                      // superclass features into this subclass
        }
