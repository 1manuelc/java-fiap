CREATING EXCEPTIONS
    
    As said before, we can create our own exceptions to
    catalogue and solve, but with few specifications.

    To create a Exception, we need to create a class that
    inherits Exception or Runtime Exception.

        * if intherits Exception, will be a Checked Exception, require to solve.

        * else, if inherits Runtime Exception, will be an Unchecked Exception, throwable and not required to solve.

    By default, Exceptions in Java have suffix "Exceptions".
