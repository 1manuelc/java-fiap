Access modifiers are reserved words that limit the access for:
- Classes
- Attributes
- Methods
- Constructors

These modifiers are:
    - Public:
        Can be used for all classes, make them visible to all packages.

    - Private:
        The element marked with it can be accessed only in the same class.

    - Protected
        Can be accessed by classes and subclasses in the same package.

    - Package ou Friendly:
        Default modifier (when you omit it)
        The element can be accessed by classes and subclasses in the same package.

Bonus polymorphism modifiers that we'll see later:
    - Static
    - Abstract
    - Final
