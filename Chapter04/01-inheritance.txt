    Inheritance is when a subclass inherits a superclass characteristics (like attributes and functions)
    To make this work, we need to add the word "extends" in the declaration of the subclass and refer
    to what class will be the superclass for the respective class.

    example:
        public class CurrentAccount extends Account {}
