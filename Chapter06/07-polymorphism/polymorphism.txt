POLYMORPHISM

    Means "quality or condition to assume different shapes".
    Specifically in development, polymorphism means multiple
    behaviours depending of the context.

    A polymorphic method results in different actions depending of the object used as reference.

    The polymorphic capacity is possible because of the
    Inheritance, 'cause allows variables of reference for
    different objects.

    Invoking the same method for different actions, the
    polymorphism remember the concept of Super and Subclasses.
