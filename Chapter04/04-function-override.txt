    Function override in subclasses work overwriting the identical function
    in the superclass. (Polymorphism artifice)
        !!! -> What determines what function will be executed is the instance (obj) used.

    Example:
        SUPERCLASS Account:
            public void removeBalance(double value) {this.balance -= value;}

        SUBCLASS CurrentAccount:
            @Override   // -> necessary to overwrite the superclass method
                public void removeBalance(double value) {
                    value += 10;
                    super.removeBalance(value);
                }

    It's important to remember that these subclasses features inherits based in the declaration, specifically
    the constructor and type of variable used.

    ! Don't delete the default constructor, the subclasses uses him in every declaration.
