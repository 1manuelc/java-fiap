MODIFIERS
    - Abstract:
        Used in Classes, make that class invisible to 
        instantiating. Just let the class be inherited
        by other subclasses.

        ex: public abstract class Account {}

    - Static:
        Used in attributes or methods of classes, let the
        reference be shared to all instances of his 
        class.

    - Final:
        Used in methods or attributes, makes the reference unalterable in every future application.
        Inverse of Abstract, don't allow subclasses for that class marked with the modifier.
        In attributes or variables, use this modifier to make it invariable, in other words, constant.

Constants are composed by three modifiers:
-> they have the three characteristics:
    - visible to all
    - unmodified in all the code
    public static final int bankNumber = 33;
