CONNECTING JAVA TO ORACLE DATABASE

In your project source directory, you'll need to create a
directory called "lib" and store inside it the wanted JDBC program in
an .jar file.
After storing him, add to the program Build Path using the IDE.
Now you're ready to connect your java program to the DB.

CLASSES:
To connect, you'll need to import some classes capable of log-in and
manage the database, like:
    - java.sql.Connection;
    - java.sql.DriverManager;
    - java.sql.SQLException;

Follow the steps to establish the connection:
    1. Define the Driver using DriveManager class.
    2. Define the connection allowing the DriverManager to manage the URL.

Now, you're able to pass SQL to the Database commands using your
java code and treat possible exceptions using the SQLException class.

example:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            //Defining the driver
            Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");

            //Connect using the driver connection with the URL
            //established in the OracleDB program.
            Connection connect = DriverManager.getConnection("url", "username", "password");
            System.out.println("Connected!");

            //Closing the connection
            connect.close();

        //Treating possible exceptions in the connecting process.
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.err.println("Error connecting to the OracleDB");
            e.printStackTrace();

        } catch (ClassNotFoundException) {
            System.err.println("JDBC Driver not found!");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
