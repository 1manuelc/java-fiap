EXCEPTIONS PROPAGATION

    We can choose to not treat an exception (with try-catch block) and simply
    propagate it, or better, delegate to the method who called the exception to
    solve it.

    The clause "throws" in the method declares exceptions that can happen and delegate to the
    method who called to solve (using try-catch possibly).
