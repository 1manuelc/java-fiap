Constructors don't are included in the inheritance, id est, don't appear in subclasses to
build them.

    How do we fix that?

00. (Optional) - You can create a default empty constructor of your subclass,
    like did in the super.
01. You'll need to create a custom constructor into the subclass.
02. He'll call the superclass constructors using "super(args here)"
03. Now you can add the particular data of your subclass.

(example):
    SUPERCLASS Account:
        public Account() {};

        public Account(int agency, int number) {
            this.agency = agency;
            this.number = number;
        }

        public Account(int agency, int number, double balance) {
            this(agency, number); // -> calls the previous constructor with these 2 parameters
            this.balance = balance;
        }

    SUBCLASS CurrentAccount:
        public CurrentAccount() {}; // --> (00)

        public CurrentAccount(int agency, int number, String type) { // --> (01)
            super(agency, number); // --> (02)
            this.type = type;      // --> (03)
        }
