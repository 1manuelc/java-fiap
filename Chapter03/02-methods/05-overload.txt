Methods overload: (Polymorphism feature)
    Two methods with the same name and modifier, but with different signatures for different applications.

    example:    deposit(double value); and
                deposit(double value, double tax);

    Can change the type and quantity of variables, but can't change the method name.
    The runtime depends on the parameters passed.

This overload works the same way for variables:
    If it exists a variable 'number' in the actual class and a variable of same name
    inside a method in the class:

    public class App {
        int number;
        
        public void createAgency(int number) {
            this.number = scanner.nextInt();
        }
    }

The difference between the two variables with equal name it is the reserved word "this",
that restricts the use of the variable for the actual scope one.
