ORACLE DATABASE AND SQL COMMANDS

    In this lesson, the teacher shows how to use
    the Oracle Database in simple steps to create
    a table to store and retrieve data from it.

    1. Install "Oracle SQL Development".
    2. Create a new connection with:
        - Connection name
        - Username
        - Password
        - Hostname
        - Port
        - Service name
        
        ps: These set of keys are much important
        to connect the program with the DBMS
        using the JDBC API, remember them carefully.

    3. Once you are connected, you can create a new
    table with well-defined tuples composed by different
    data types.
    4. Create a sequence for the PK in every table,
    starting with 1 and increasing by 1 every time.


MOST COMMON SQL COMMANDS

    INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT & DELETE (DML Commands)
    
    These commands are easily made dragging the table
    to a query builder in the graphic interface, it'll
    ask step by step in a wizard what you want to do.
