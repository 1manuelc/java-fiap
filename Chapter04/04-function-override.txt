    Function override in subclasses work as an overwriting over the identical function in the superclass.

    Example:
        SUPERCLASS Account:
            public void removeBalance(double value) {this.balance -= value;}

        SUBCLASS CurrentAccount:
            @Override
                public void removeBalance(double value) {
                    value += 10;
                    super.removeBalance(value);
                }

    It's important to remember that these subclasses features inherits based in the declaration, specifically
    the constructor and type of variable used.

    ! Don't delete the default constructor, the subclasses uses him in every declaration.
